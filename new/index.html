            <p>Fluid 0.4 is a new PureScript implementation of Fluid developed by <a href="https://dynamicaspects.org/research/">Roly Perera</a> and <a href="https://github.com/min-nguyen/">Minh Nguyen</a>, implementing the ideas described in our <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00445">POPL 2022 submission</a>, co-authored with <a href="http://tomasp.net/">Tomas Petricek</a> and <a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/people/person/Meng-Wang-c7e34d58-549c-4456-ad41-8392dab75a91/">Meng Wang</a>. The implementation is currently much slower than the 0.3 TypeScript implementation because of a naive approach to computing environment joins; we will fix this in the forthcoming 0.5 release.</p>

            <p>The following figures (which will take several seconds to load) are generated by our implementation. The first one was used for Figure 2 in the paper, and shows how dualising the Galois dependency analysis flips the direction of the Galois connection, by swapping the roles of the upper and lower adjoints. Doing so transforms the analysis from something which determines what we can compute with some selected data into something which determines what we cannot compute without the selected data. This offers a principled basis for an automated brushing and linking feature between two cognate outputs, as shown above. When the user selects part of the output of one (the highlighted bar in the bar chart on the left), we can use backward dependency to compute the needed data, and then the De Morgan dual of the forward dependency to compute the parts of the second output that depend on any of that data (the highlighted points in the line chart on the right).</p>

            <p>The following two figures were used for Figure 13 in the paper, and show the four dependency relations. Each figure corresponds to one of the four possible round-trips. The first shows the backward-evaluation Galois connection and how it round-trips with the forward analysis; the second shows the De Morgan dual of the forward analysis and how it round-trips with the De Morgan dual of the backward analysis. These are both described in detail in the paper.

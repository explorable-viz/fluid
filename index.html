	<p>Digital technology is transforming the way scientists generate, evaluate and communicate knowledge. <b>Fluid</b> is a functional programming language which makes computational artefacts such as charts, figures and statistical analyses more transparent and explorable. A Fluid chart is written as a purely functional view, but the generated charts provide affordances that allow a reader to discover how views relate to each other, and to the underlying code and datasets. The current prototype allows us to <emph>link</emph> charts to other charts, so that the reader can highlight parts of one chart and have the relevant parts of the other chart be automatically highlighted, and vice versa (best viewed in Chrome):

	<div id="app-root"></div>

	<p>The left chart show total renewable energy output for bio, hydro, solar and wind (colour-coded) for China, USA and Germany in 2015. The chart on the right shows China's renewables output over time for the same four energy types, with the black line plotting the total. Dependency-wise, these two charts are "cognate": they have common data dependencies. Now consider the data for China in the left chart. How does this relate to what we can see in the other chart? Well, the chart on the left is a <emph>stacked</emph> bar chart, meaning it represents a running total. Thus, if we consider each rectangle in the stacked bar for China, starting from the bottom, the <emph>y-coordinate</emph> of each rectangle represents the <emph>sum</emph> of an increasing number of 2015 data points in the right-hand chart.

	<p>Fluid lets us explore these relationships. For example, you can express interest in the y-coordinate of a rectangle by moving your mouse towards its bottom edge. Doing so will pop up a toolship showing the value of that attribute, and as well as any attributes in the other chart that depend on the same underlying data. Visualisation libraries such as <a href="https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/">Bokeh</a> and spatial analytics applications like <a href="https://geodacenter.github.io/">GeoDa</a> provide limited support for this kind of linking, but usually only for specific predefined visualisations, or with a certain amount of programmer effort. Fluid takes a more foundational approach, through a <b>dependency-tracking runtime</b> that makes linking automatic and pervasive.

	<p>To see the Fluid code for the above charts, open the Wrattler notebook in <a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/wrattler/wrattler-examples/master?urlpath=lab/tree/examples">Binder</a>, and then open the <code>fluid-example.wrattler</code> notebook. (Warning: Binder is slow; Wrattler will take several minutes to launch even from a prebuilt image.) Fluid is open source and is available on <a href="https://github.com/rolyp/fluid">GitHub</a>, so you can also see the example code <a href="https://github.com/rolyp/fluid/tree/master/fluid/example/graphics">there</a>.

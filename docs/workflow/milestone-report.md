# Milestone Reports and Release Notes

When a milestone branch is merged to develop, two documents are generated from the same git history and GitHub issue data.

## Release notes

Outward-facing summary of what changed. Audience: users and contributors.

Stored at `docs/releases/<milestone-name>.md`.

```
# <milestone-name>

## Features
- <one-line description> (#<issue>)

## Bug fixes
- <one-line description> (#<issue>)

## Breaking changes
- <one-line description> (#<issue>)

## Other
- <one-line description> (#<issue>)
```

## Milestone report

Inward-facing audit trail and metrics. Audience: development team.

Stored at `docs/reports/<milestone-name>.md`.

```
# Milestone: <name>

## Summary
- Issues completed: N
- Issues remaining: N (with statuses)
- Date range: YYYY-MM-DD to YYYY-MM-DD

## Issues

### #<number>: <title>
- **Status**: Done | Awaiting Decision | Paused
- **Commits**: N total, N by Claude, N by human
- **Files modified**: N
- **Decision points**: autonomous | human intervention required
  - <brief description of any decisions escalated or made>

(repeated for each issue)

## Metrics
- Total commits: N
- Claude-authored commits: N (N%)
- Human-authored commits: N (N%)
- Total files modified: N
- Issues completed autonomously: N
- Issues requiring human intervention: N
```

## Generation

**Milestone reports** are built incrementally: each issue's entry is added when the issue is closed. The summary and metrics sections are updated at the same time. This keeps the report current throughout the milestone.

**Release notes** are generated when the milestone branch is merged to develop, categorised by issue labels (`implementation` → Features, `testing`/`setup` → Other, etc.) and can be edited before publishing.

Both draw from:
- **Git history**: commits on the milestone branch since it diverged from develop. Claude-authored commits identified by `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer.
- **GitHub issues**: status, labels, and comments. Decision points identified from "Awaiting Decision" status transitions and escalation comments.
- **File counts**: `git diff --stat` between the milestone branch base and head.
